### Territorial Density Analysis of Soybean Production – São Paulo (2021)

This project analyzes soybean production in São Paulo using a territorial density approach instead of traditional total-volume ranking.

Instead of asking *"who produces more?"*, we ask:

> How concentrated is soybean production within each municipality's territory?

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a structured geospatial pipeline that:

- Collects official agricultural production data (IBGE – SIDRA API)
- Integrates municipal territorial boundaries
- Calculates territorial production density (ton/km²)
- Classifies municipalities statistically
- Generates analytical outputs and visualization

This project demonstrates practical spatial data engineering applied to agribusiness intelligence.

## 🧠 Methodological Approach

### 1️⃣ Territorial Base

- Municipal boundaries (São Paulo – 2024)
- Reprojected to **SIRGAS 2000 / UTM Zone 23S (EPSG:31983)**
- Area recalculated in km² for analytical consistency

---

### 2️⃣ Agricultural Data

Source: IBGE – Produção Agrícola Municipal (PAM)  
Table: 1612  
Product: Soybean (Soja em grão)  
Year: 2021  
Variable: Quantidade produzida (Toneladas)

Data collected directly from SIDRA API.

---

### 3️⃣ Density Calculation

Territorial density was calculated as:

```python
densidade_ton_km2 = producao_ton / area_km2
```

This shifts the analysis from absolute production to spatial intensity.

4️⃣ Statistical Classification

Municipalities with zero production were isolated before classification.

Quantile classification (q=3) was applied only to positive density values, generating:

Baixa

Média

Alta

This prevents distortion caused by structural zeros and ensures stable segmentation.

Final categories:

Sem produção

Baixa

Média

Alta

📊 Key Insights

Production density is strongly concentrated in the southwest region of São Paulo.

Coastal municipalities show structural absence of soybean production.

Several municipalities rank high in territorial density despite not leading in total volume.

Density-based ranking provides different strategic insights compared to total production ranking.

📌 Why This Matters

Traditional agricultural analysis often focuses only on total production.

Territorial density introduces a spatial intelligence perspective:

Credit allocation

Risk modeling

Logistics planning

Regional investment strategy

Land-use intensity evaluation

This approach bridges agricultural data with geospatial analytics.
